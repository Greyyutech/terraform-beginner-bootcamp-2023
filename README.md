# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023

## Semantic Versioning :mage:

This project is going utilize semantic versioning for its tagging.
[semver.org](https://semver.org/)
Given a version number **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, increment the:

The genernal format:

**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, eg. `1.0.1`

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes


## Install the Terraform CLI

### Considerations with the Terraform CLI changes
The Terraform CLI installation instructions have chagned due to gpg keying changes. So we needed to refer to the latest install CLI instructions via Terraform Documentation and chagne the scripting for installation.


[Install Terraform CLI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)

## Refacting into Bash Scripts
While fixing the Terraforms CLI gpg depreciation issues we notice that bash scripts steps were a considerateable amount more code. So we decided to create a bash script to install the Terraform CLI.

This bash script is located here: [.bin/install_terraform_cli](./bin/install_terraform_cli)

- Thi will keep the Gitpod Task File ([.gitpod.yml]([.gitpod.yml))tidy.
- This allow us an easier to debug and execute manually Terraform CLI install
- This wil allow better portablity for other projects that need to install Terraform CLI.

#### Shebang Consideratiaons

A Shebang (pronced Sha-bang) tells the bash script what program that will interpet the script. eg. `#!/bin/bash`

ChatGPT recommended this format for bash: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`

- for portability for different OS distributions
- will search the user's PATH for the bash executable

#### Execution Considerations
When executing the bash script we can use the `./` shorthand notiationto execute the bash script.

#### Linux Considerations

#### Working Env Vars

We can list out all Environment Variables (Env Vars) Using the `env` command

We can filter specfic env vars using grep eg. `env | grep AWS_`

#### Setting and Unsetting Env Vars

In the termininal we can set using `export HELLO='world'`

In the termininal we can unset using `unset HELLO`

We can set an env var temporarily when just running a command

```sh
HELLO='world' ./bin/print_message
```

Wwithin a bash script we can set env without writing export eg.

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

HELLO='world'

echo $HELLO
```

#### Printing Vars

We can print an env var using echo eg. `echo $HELLO`

#### Scoping of Env Vars

When you open up new bash terminal in VSCode it will not be aware of env vars that you have set in another window.

If you want to Env Vars to persist across all future bash terminals that are open you need to set env vars in your bash profile. eg. `.bash_profile`

#### Persisting Env Vars in Gitpod

we can persist env vars into gitpod by storing them in Gitpod Secrets Storage.

```
gp env HELLO=`world`
```

All future workspaces launched will set the env vars for all bash terminals opened in those workspaces.

You can also set en vars in the `.gitpod.yml` but this can only contain non-senstive env vars.
